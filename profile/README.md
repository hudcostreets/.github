# Hudson County Complete Streets

Our mission is to improve connectivity and transportation equity in Hudson County by advocating for safe streets, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure, and access to transit in each community. We believe a more connected Hudson County that is safe for pedestrians, cyclists, scooters, skaters, people in wheelchairs, and other vulnerable road users will promote the health and well-being of our more than 750,000 residents by providing people of all ages and abilities more mobility options.
